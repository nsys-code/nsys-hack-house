About
=====

The IoT dashboard showing data from sensors. The goal is to create an application 
showing metrics from various sensors (humidity, temperature etc) located in a smart 
home and/or building. Based on collected data the dashboard can provide analytic 
and predictions data such as energy saving, house happiness etc. Access to external 
data for dashboard is based on adapters where an individual adapter is providing 
access to data from particular vendor and/or IoT platform.

The Nsys #HackTheHouse implementation is based on the Nsys Platform.
